TO OUR PREDECESSORS: 

First, we'd like to congratulate you on picking up this wonderful project! Feel free to make a clone of this repository, and everything we've prepared should get you started. The Unity packages can be imported directly into the editor so that you're able to see the entire workflow of what we've implemented. We've also included a working demo for you to preview and decide whether it's something you'd like to pursue. However, if Unity is not what you have in mind, worry not; you can still use the code we've written.

Much respect,
Team K, May 2024
